## British Energy Storage Manufacturers of the most flexible energy storage solution on or off the grid.

Here at Multi Source Power our team of experts design, build, and deliver Battery Energy Storage Systems for both on- and off-grid applications. Our high-performance modular BESS fully integrates into any power plant to accelerate return on investment on projects across the globe. 

We have a wealth of experience with solutions across the UK and internationally leveraging our low OPEX, energy-dense technology to enable customers to optimise their energy objectives and create new revenue streams from frequency balancing, curtailment and other grid services including dynamic containment. 

Our storage systems also provide solutions to projects outside of traditional markets, where stable power can be scarce and investing in the right equipment is vital in providing consumers, businesses and investors with stable power grids. Our grid-forming BESSs tour the globe fuelling high profile events, providing power solutions to some of the remotest communities and reinforce island grids through hybridisation, DC-coupled solar and other renewables.

We are proudly British Made, working to enable the UK and countries around the world to achieve their net zero carbon ambitions.
